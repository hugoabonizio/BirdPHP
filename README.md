**BirdsPHP** is a [web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework) written in PHP inspired by Ruby on Rails made for fast and easy web development. It's goal is to take advantages of Rails principles (*C*onvention *O*ver *C*onfiguration, *D*on't *R*epeat *Y*ourself) and adapt this to PHP language ecosystem. Like Rails, **BirdsPHP** have command line generator to create parts of the project - like models, controllers and views - easier and faster.
